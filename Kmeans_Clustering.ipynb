        "* __For customer segmentation:__ You can cluster your customers based on their purchases,their activity on your website, and so on. This is useful to understand who your customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and marketing campaigns to each segment. For example, this can be useful in recommender systems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.Subdivision of customers into groups/segments such that each customer segment consists of customers with similar market characteristics — pricing , loyalty, spending behaviors etc. Some of the segmentation variables could be e.g., number of items bought on sale, avg transaction value, total number of transactions. Customer segmentation allows businesses to customize market programs that will be suitable for each of its customer segments\n",
        "\n",
        "* __For data analysis:__ When analyzing a new dataset, it is often useful to first discover clusters of similar instances, as it is often easier to analyze clusters separately.\n",

        "* __Inventory Categorization based on sales or other manufacturing metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "* __For anomaly detection (also called outlier detection):__ Any instance that has a low affinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clustered the users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with unusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second, and so on. Anomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or for fraud detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* __For search engines:__ For example, some search engines let you search for images that are similar to a reference image. To build such a system, you would first apply a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database: similar images would end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image, all you need to do is to find this image’s cluster using the trained clustering model, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "* __To segment an image:__ By clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing each pixel’s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to reduce the number of different colors in the image considerably. This technique is used in many object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the contour of each object.\n"

It first considers all the points to be part of one big cluster and in the subsequent steps tries to find out the points/ clusters which are least similar to each other and then breaks the bigger cluster into smaller ones. This continues until there are as many clusters as there are datapoints. This is also called the top-down approach."
